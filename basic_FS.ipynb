    "* only **10 actually help prediction**\n",
    "* rest are just **noise**\n",
    "* some are **duplicates**\n",
    "* some are **misleading**\n",

    "If you feed everything to the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ model learns garbage\n",
    "❌ overfitting increases\n",
    "❌ training slows\n",
    "❌ interpretability dies\n",

    "## 🎯 Why data scientists care about feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Think like this:\n",

    "Even a simple Logistic Regression can beat XGBoost\n",
